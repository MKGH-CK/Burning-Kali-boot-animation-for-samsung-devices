# Burning-Kali-boot-animation-for-samsung-devices
This is qmg file of burning kali boot animation of nethunter.
I was looking for file but couldn't find so made my own

# steps of applying animation
1) download both bootsamsung.qmg and bootsamsungloop.qmg
2) Replace them with files of same name in /system/Media/
3) Done animation is applied.

# *Note* : 
1) copy original boot files so that you can restore them if wanted.
2) Don't share without credit.
3) It is necessary to place both files to prevent bootloop.
